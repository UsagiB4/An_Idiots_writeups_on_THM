# **Atlassian, CVE-2022-26134**
___
### Let's begin:
___
#### Module 1
First we'll look at the CVE-2022-26134 to have a better understanding.
The room provides basic info about the ***vulnerability***.
like:
- it was first found in May, 30, 2022
- it scored 9.8 on NIST
- And some vulnerable Confluence version [list](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26134).

Module 1:
- - question 1.1 --> "module contains the answer. Look closely"
- - question 1.2 --> if you look at the list of vulnerable version you will find 
  > 7.16.0 -> 7.16.4
  >> Which means this "vulnerability" exists from version 7.16.0 below 7.16.4
  >>> That means 7.16.2 is fucked up.

#### Module 2
Before we move into it and turn on the machine, I would like (and suggest you) to watch some **POC** on youtube or read some articles. That will give you some basic overall idea about the vulnerability and how it works.

Here are some video that I watched before diving deep into this room:
- [New Zero-Day Vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence! (CVE-2022-26134) --> 0x4rkÃ˜](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggo7FB45pA&ab_channel=0x4rk%C3%98)
- [Confluence RCE CVE 2022-26134 --> Metasploit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-K3krf3ARg&ab_channel=Metasploit)
- [CVE-2022-26134 - Atlassian Confluence OGNL injection vulnerability --> Necrum Security Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoPVDMihNgA&ab_channel=NecrumSecurityLabs)

`N.B: these are just some random suggestion that I found useful for me. I'm not play favorite here.`

#### Module 3
After reading the module you can find some ***interesting*** things about this vulnerability:

1. This is a f@cking `java` based web app.
2. This uses `OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language)` expression language

Module 3:
- - question 3.1: Look up for the answer. **BRAHHHHHHH**
___
#### Module 4
This module is more about patching. I'm not into it, so I'll skip this.
___
#### Module 5
**AND NOW**

welcome to the real world.

Here we'll test and find the vulnerability. But first you have to start the machine.
`if you forget that part, go ahead and start that sucker and wait for at least 7 mins`

> To exploit this machine we will need a tool named after this CVE.
>> You can find it on [github](https://github.com/Nwqda/CVE-2022-26134). Go and download that **Boi**.

>> Now after getting the tool you have to run it using the command: `python3 cve-2022-26134.py http://YOUR_MACHINE_IP:8090/ "COMMAND"`

> In "COMMAND" you have to put your command to find the answers.

Module 5:
- - question 1.3: 
- - - use the command that shows the `username` on linux
- - question 1.4
> before answering the question, I want to inform you that if you want to run single command like `ls` `pwd` `whoami` `ifconfig` you don't need to put them into `" "` mark. But if you want to run a command with value, you have to put it into `" "` mark like:
>
>single command:
`python3 cve-2022-26134.py https://target.com CMD`
>
>command with param: `python3 cve-2022-26134.py https://target.com "cat something.txt"`
- - Now let's answer the question.
- - to get what's inside the `flat.txt` you have to find it first.
- - try `ls` to see all the available files.
- - did you find something?
- - if yes, then use `cat` command to do the rest.

And here we are. All done.
