# **Atlassian, CVE-2022-26134**
___
### Let's begin:
___
#### Module 1
First we'll look at the CVE-2022-26134 to have a better understanding.
The room provides basic info about the ***vulnerability***.
like:
- it was first found in May, 30, 2022
- it scored 9.8 on NIST
- And some vulnerable Confluence version [list](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26134).

Module 1:
- - question 1.1 --> "module contains the answer. Look closely"
- - question 1.2 --> if you look at the list of vulnerable version you will find 
  > 7.16.0 -> 7.16.4
  >> Which means this "vulnerability" exists from version 7.16.0 below 7.16.4
  >>> That means 7.16.2 is fucked up.

#### Module 2
Before we move into it and turn on the machine, I would like (and suggest you) to watch some **POC** on youtube or read some articles. That will give you some basic overall idea about the vulnerability and how it works.

Here are some video that I watched before diving deep into this room:
