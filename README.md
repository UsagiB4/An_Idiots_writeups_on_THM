# Try Hack Me
Whassup hackers? This is a dumb **right-up**/**walk-through** of some of the `tryhackme` room.
### What you can do with this ***Readmes***
_____________________________
actually you don't need to read this entire bullsh!t.
I was just keeping some notes so I thought, **"Hmmmmmmmmmm, what if I put these as a README in github and some people who are just beginning and need help get help from this???? That would be great."**
And that's how ladies and gentle Hackers, it all started. 

***N.B***: 
```
Not good at write everything down and put sh1ts together.
So if you find something which is wrong, feel free to inform me.
